Sitting in a noodle bar, finishing my second bowl.
Flash of memory: pasta with pepper, pasta with cardamom,
Sometimes just with salt. Waiting for the weekend treat.
Not noticing mother’s sullen face, awaiting my sugary pasta with milk.
Nutritionist’s little nightmare, now I remember, pale.
The memory locked: trauma, or mother’s care?
And if I forgot, how many did not remember?
How many times will we face 1932 December?
